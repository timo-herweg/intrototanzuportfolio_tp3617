## VMware Tanzu Advanced Edition

Tanzu Advanced helps operations and security teams implement the right level of controls, freeing developers to focus on building and delivering modern applications. For example, enterprises keen to embrace containers will find Tanzu Advanced enables operators to curate and secure a set of container images so that developers can grab and go, using those validated images to speed up their development efforts. Source code provenance and dependencies are all tracked and auditable. Enterprises that use Tanzu Advanced gain developer velocity, better security from code to customer, and operator efficiency.

Please see the following video for a brief overview of the VMware Tanzu Advanced Edition:

## Tanzu Advanced and the App and DevSecops Transformations

![The Three Cloud Transformations](../tanzuThreeTransformations.png)

### The DevSecOps Transformation

Automating and accelerating the path from code to production in a consistent and repeatable way means building a platform for developers. As observed in the latest State of DevOps report, internal platforms are a hallmark of DevOps high performers. But these platforms have to be "a compelling option" for application teams. Tanzu Advanced is a solution for securing the container lifecycle while reducing developer toil. 

Building a DevSecOps platform requires a product mindset for continuous improvement. Tanzu makes it easier for DevOps platform builders to create a compelling developer experience and meet security requirements.

Please see the following video for a brief introduction and demo of VMware Tanzu DevSecOps features:

### The Application Transformation

Developers are adopting new app architectures, like microservices, serverless, and reactive patterns. According to the [2020 State of Spring survey](https://tanzu.vmware.com/content/ebooks/state-of-spring-2020), 83 percent of Spring developers are building microservices, with another 33 percent using Reactive and 32 percent developing serverless applications. These new patterns aren't frivolous pursuits of the intellectually curious. They deliver material value, such as supporting faster time to production of new features, or a better user experience in the face of latency and complex processing.

How do we enable adoption of these patterns and remove friction in the developer experience? The less time a developer has to spend engineering how a new thing will work, the better. That takes developer-friendly collaboration and platform services that offload architectural infrastructure. 

Many modern architectures come at some cost of complexity. Offloading what developers have to spend time on is essential for adoption. Tanzu makes it easier for developers to focus on their business or integration logic, and spend less time engineering system infrastructure.

#### VMware Tanzu Application Platform

**Please Note:** VMware Tanzu Application Platform is currently in beta. Pricing and Packaging information are not currently available.

VMware Tanzu Application Platform delivers a superior developer experience for enterprises building and deploying cloud native applications on Kubernetes. It enables application teams to get to production faster by automating source to production pipelines, and it clearly defines the roles of developers and operators so they can work collaboratively instead of stepping on each other’s toes.

The Tanzu Application Platform beta includes foundational elements that enable developers to quickly begin building and testing applications regardless of their familiarity with Kubernetes. Operations teams can create application scaffolding templates with baked-in security and compliance guardrails, making those considerations mostly invisible to developers. Starting with the templates, developers turn source code into a container and get a URL to test their app in minutes. Once the container is built, updating it happens automatically every time there’s a new code commit or dependency patch. And connecting to other applications and data, regardless of how they’re built or what kind of infrastructure they run on, has never been easier thanks to an internal API management portal.

### VMware Tanzu Application Service for VMs

**Please Note:** VMware Tanzu Application Service is sold independently and is not included in the VMware Tanzu Advanced Edition.

VMware Tanzu Application Service for VMs (TAS) is a modern application platform for enterprises that want to continuously deliver and run microservices securely at scale both on-premises and across clouds.

TAS for VMs provides application development teams an automated path to production for custom code, and a secure, highly available runtime that scales to support the most demanding operations teams.

Key Benefits include:
- **Speed:** Tanzu Application Service enables rapid time to value for your custom code by managing everything else for you.
- **Scalability:** Tanzu Application Service uses Cloud Foundry BOSH to help deliver enterprise SLAs as the business grows.
- **Secure by default:** Tanzu Application Service is highly automated and improves the security posture across the application portfolio, dramatically lowering risks posed by manual processes.

As an industry-standard cloud platform, TAS for VMs offers the following:

- **Open source code:** The platform’s openness and extensibility prevent its users from being locked into a single framework, set of app services, or cloud. For more information, see the [Cloud Foundry project on GitHub](https://github.com/cloudfoundry).
- **Deployment automation:** Developers can deploy their apps to TAS for VMs using their existing tools and with zero modification to their code.
- **Flexible infrastructure:** You can deploy TAS for VMs to run your apps on your own computing infrastructure, or deploy on an IaaS like vSphere, AWS, Azure, GCP, or OpenStack.
- **Commercial options:** You can also use a PaaS deployed by a commercial TAS for VMs cloud provider. For more information, see [Cloud Foundry Certified Platforms](https://www.cloudfoundry.org/certified-platforms/).
- **Community support:** A broad community contributes to and supports TAS for VMs. See [Welcome to the Cloud Foundry Community](https://www.cloudfoundry.org/community/).

TAS for VMs is ideal for anyone interested in removing the cost and complexity of configuring infrastructure for their apps.
