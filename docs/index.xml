&lt;h2 id="content-accuracy-and-refresh-cycle">Content Accuracy and Refresh Cycle&lt;/h2>
&lt;p>We make a strong effort to keep the content in this course as current as possible, however the Tanzu Portfolio is rapidly growing and there may be times where this course may not include the newest updates. Always refer to the official &lt;a href="https://tanzu.vmware.com/">VMware Tanzu Portfiolio Website&lt;/a> and your VMware account team for the latest details on products covered in this course.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>As part of our effort to keep this course as up-to-date as possible, this course is on a continuous update lifecycle. This means that the course can be updated at any time, and new content and requirements may be added while you are taking your course. We will make effort to notify members in advance of any significant updates are made to minimize any unexpected changes to course completion requirements.&lt;/p>
&lt;h2 id="enrollment-tests--completion-badge">Enrollment, Tests &amp;amp; Completion Badge&lt;/h2>
&lt;p>All content in this course is publicly viewable, no registration or enrollment is required to view course materials.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>However, the course offers enrollment and provides a test which if completed successfully can award participants with an official digital badge validating successful completion of the course.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>ModernApps Learning uses GitOps methods for course enrollment, testing and badging, to help teach and validate important git and devops skills for course participants. Instructions for each step is provided within this course; however if you are new to Git or want to learn more about the ModernApps Learning by VMware Tanzu program, we recommend taking the &lt;a href="https://modernapps.ninja/modernappsskills101_ms4043/docs/">ModernApps Skills 101 Course&lt;/a> as it provides instructions on joining the community, course enrollment, test taking, and how to request a digital badge when you complete a course.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Below please find detailed instructions for Enrolling for this course:&lt;/p>
&lt;h3 id="enroll-for-this-course">Enroll for this course&lt;/h3>
&lt;p>You must first be a member of the community before you can enroll for this course. Ensure that you have fully completed the community member enrollment process before proceeding.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>To enroll for this course, follow the detailed instructions below to post a simple file with your github username to this repository. This process, while simple to follow, helps participants to gain experience and comfort, and validate their knowledge with foundational devops tools and process.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Posting a file to enroll uses the git pull request process, which is one of the most important and common foundational skills for participating in devops, cloud native, and infrastructure modernization initiatives.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>This process will also show on your public github profile that you have made a commit, the course also provides several additional exercises throughout where you will make commits to gain additional git experience while enhancing your github and professional profiles.&lt;/p>
&lt;h4 id="step-1---open-the-new-course-enrollment-document-link">Step 1 - Open the new course enrollment document link&lt;/h4>
&lt;p>&lt;strong>The Course Enrollment Process Requires that you have a github account, and that you are signed in using the github account you want to be enrolled for the course. If you attempt to enroll a different account than the account you are signed in as, the process will fail.&lt;/strong>&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Please right click the following link and select the option to open it in a new browser tab, so you can keep this instruction page open in the current tab to guide you through the process.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>&lt;a href="https://github.com/ModernAppsNinja/intrototanzuportfolio_tp3617/tree/main/static/admin/userdata/registered_members">Right Click Here and select the option to open link in new tab&lt;/a> and click on &lt;code>Add File &amp;gt; Create new file&lt;/code>&lt;/p>
&lt;h4 id="step-2---name-your-file">Step 2 - Name your file&lt;/h4>
&lt;p>Note the page displays a message that &lt;code>You’re making changes in a project you don’t have write access to. Submitting a change will write it to a new branch in your fork YOUR_GITHUB_USERNAME/COURSE_REPOSITORY_NAME, so you can send a pull request.&lt;/code>&lt;/p>
&lt;p>The pull request process works by submitting a copy of your new or updated file to the repository, which will only be applied to the course repository if a course administrator approves the request. Because you do not have write access to the repository, github will create a special copy called a &lt;code>fork&lt;/code> of the course repository within your github account with your new or updated files, and use your copy to save the updates you&amp;rsquo;re submitting to the official course repository as shown in the following steps.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>In your browser tab to the new enrollment document, above the document editor in the file name field, type in the name of the file in the format &lt;code>your_github_username.yml&lt;/code>, replacing the value &lt;strong>your_github_username&lt;/strong> with the username for your github account.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>&lt;strong>Please be sure to include the .yml file extension in your filename. One of the most common mistakes people make in this process is not including the .yml file extension in the filename, and if this is not included, the automation that processes enrollement will not be triggered and your enrollment request will fail.&lt;/strong>&lt;/p>
&lt;p>The following screenshot shows an example of this step using the github username &lt;code>Oni-no-Hanzo&lt;/code>&lt;/p>
&lt;p>&lt;strong>Note:&lt;/strong> If needed, you can verify your github username by clicking on your github profile menu, which can be found on the upper right hand corner on any github page if you are signed in.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>&lt;img src="https://modernapps.ninja/course_repo_template_ct8279/admin/assets/images/course_registration_file_naming.png" alt="Screenshot of File Naming">&lt;/p>
&lt;h4 id="step-3---add-a-line-to-your-file">Step 3 - Add a line to your file&lt;/h4>
&lt;p>On line 1 in the document editor, type &lt;code>status: in-progress&lt;/code> as shown in the following screenshot:&lt;/p>
&lt;p>&lt;img src="https://modernapps.ninja/course_repo_template_ct8279/admin/assets/images/course_registration_file_editing.png" alt="Screenshot of File Editing">&lt;/p>
&lt;h4 id="step-4---submit-your-enrollment-document">Step 4 - Submit your enrollment document&lt;/h4>
&lt;p>Scroll to the bottom of the enrollment document page and click &lt;code>Propose New File&lt;/code> as shown in the following image:&lt;/p>
&lt;p>&lt;img src="https://github.com/ModernAppsNinja/course_repo_template_ct8279/blob/main/static/admin/assets/images/propose_changes.png" alt="Propose New File Screenshot">&lt;/p>
&lt;p>After you click &lt;code>Propose New File&lt;/code>, your browser will be redirected to the &lt;code>Comparing Changes&lt;/code> page with all the configuration all setup so all you sould need to do is click &lt;code>Create Pull Request&lt;/code> &amp;mdash; but before you click, please review the other details shown on the comparing changes and observe that the file you created and the lines added are shown, so you can easily review and verify your proposed changes before submitting.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>After you click &lt;code>Create pull request&lt;/code>, an automated GitHub Action worklow will initiate that will do the following actions:&lt;/p>
&lt;ul>
&lt;li>verify that your github account is a member of the modernappsninja organization&lt;/li>
&lt;li>verify the filename of the submitted document matches the github username of the logged-in user that submitted the pull request&lt;/li>
&lt;li>if the above items are successfully validated:
&lt;ul>
&lt;li>add the course record page to the members profile repository to display course progress and completion records&lt;/li>
&lt;li>add a message to the pull request ticket with the URL for the members course record page&lt;/li>
&lt;li>trigger github to send an email from github to the email address for the github user account that submitted the pull request including the message from the previous step&lt;/li>
&lt;li>approve and merge the new document you submitted into the registered members directory for this course&lt;/li>
&lt;/ul>
&lt;/li>

&lt;h2 id="vmwares-vision-for-app-and-cloud-modernization">VMware&amp;rsquo;s Vision for App and Cloud Modernization&lt;/h2>
&lt;p>Every organization is now defined by the digital services it delivers. From engaging customers with new experiences, to building new revenue opportunities, and driving digital-first touchpoints that protect and enable customers and communities, these services have never been more essential.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>But transformation isn’t happening fast enough. While expectations are high, efforts are slowed or stalled by the complexity of existing apps, interdependencies with existing infrastructure, diversity across public clouds, and silos of infrastructure, operations and security. Nearly every organization can feel the tension between the opportunities tied to transformation and the daunting challenge of how to achieve it.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Please see the following video to learn about VMware&amp;rsquo;s Vision for App and Cloud Transformation:&lt;/p>

&lt;h2 id="vmware-tanzu-advanced-edition">VMware Tanzu Advanced Edition&lt;/h2>
&lt;p>Tanzu Advanced helps operations and security teams implement the right level of controls, freeing developers to focus on building and delivering modern applications. For example, enterprises keen to embrace containers will find Tanzu Advanced enables operators to curate and secure a set of container images so that developers can grab and go, using those validated images to speed up their development efforts. Source code provenance and dependencies are all tracked and auditable. Enterprises that use Tanzu Advanced gain developer velocity, better security from code to customer, and operator efficiency.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Please see the following video for a brief overview of the VMware Tanzu Advanced Edition:&lt;/p>

&lt;h3 id="the-devsecops-transformation">The DevSecOps Transformation&lt;/h3>
&lt;p>Automating and accelerating the path from code to production in a consistent and repeatable way means building a platform for developers. As observed in the latest State of DevOps report, internal platforms are a hallmark of DevOps high performers. But these platforms have to be &amp;ldquo;a compelling option&amp;rdquo; for application teams. Tanzu Advanced is a solution for securing the container lifecycle while reducing developer toil.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Building a DevSecOps platform requires a product mindset for continuous improvement. Tanzu makes it easier for DevOps platform builders to create a compelling developer experience and meet security requirements.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Please see the following video for a brief introduction and demo of VMware Tanzu DevSecOps features:&lt;/p>
&lt;div style="position: relative; padding-bottom: 56.25%; height: 0; overflow: hidden;">
&lt;iframe src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/KChElTkBJvU" style="position: absolute; top: 0; left: 0; width: 100%; height: 100%; border:0;" allowfullscreen title="YouTube Video">&lt;/iframe>
&lt;/div>
&lt;h3 id="the-application-transformation">The Application Transformation&lt;/h3>
&lt;p>Developers are adopting new app architectures, like microservices, serverless, and reactive patterns. According to the &lt;a href="https://tanzu.vmware.com/content/ebooks/state-of-spring-2020">2020 State of Spring survey&lt;/a>, 83 percent of Spring developers are building microservices, with another 33 percent using Reactive and 32 percent developing serverless applications. These new patterns aren&amp;rsquo;t frivolous pursuits of the intellectually curious. They deliver material value, such as supporting faster time to production of new features, or a better user experience in the face of latency and complex processing.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>How do we enable adoption of these patterns and remove friction in the developer experience? The less time a developer has to spend engineering how a new thing will work, the better. That takes developer-friendly collaboration and platform services that offload architectural infrastructure.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Many modern architectures come at some cost of complexity. Offloading what developers have to spend time on is essential for adoption. Tanzu makes it easier for developers to focus on their business or integration logic, and spend less time engineering system infrastructure.&lt;/p>
&lt;h4 id="vmware-tanzu-application-platform">VMware Tanzu Application Platform&lt;/h4>
&lt;p>&lt;strong>Please Note:&lt;/strong> VMware Tanzu Application Platform is currently in beta. Pricing and Packaging information are not currently available.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>VMware Tanzu Application Platform delivers a superior developer experience for enterprises building and deploying cloud native applications on Kubernetes. It enables application teams to get to production faster by automating source to production pipelines, and it clearly defines the roles of developers and operators so they can work collaboratively instead of stepping on each other’s toes.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>The Tanzu Application Platform beta includes foundational elements that enable developers to quickly begin building and testing applications regardless of their familiarity with Kubernetes. Operations teams can create application scaffolding templates with baked-in security and compliance guardrails, making those considerations mostly invisible to developers. Starting with the templates, developers turn source code into a container and get a URL to test their app in minutes. Once the container is built, updating it happens automatically every time there’s a new code commit or dependency patch. And connecting to other applications and data, regardless of how they’re built or what kind of infrastructure they run on, has never been easier thanks to an internal API management portal.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Please see the following video for a brief introduction and demo of VMware Tanzu Application Platform:&lt;/p>
&lt;div style="position: relative; padding-bottom: 56.25%; height: 0; overflow: hidden;">

&lt;h3 id="vmware-tanzu-application-service-for-vms">VMware Tanzu Application Service for VMs&lt;/h3>
&lt;p>&lt;strong>Please Note:&lt;/strong> VMware Tanzu Application Service is sold independently and is not included in the VMware Tanzu Advanced Edition.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>VMware Tanzu Application Service for VMs (TAS) is a modern application platform for enterprises that want to continuously deliver and run microservices securely at scale both on-premises and across clouds.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>TAS for VMs provides application development teams an automated path to production for custom code, and a secure, highly available runtime that scales to support the most demanding operations teams.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Key Benefits include:&lt;/p>
&lt;ul>
&lt;li>&lt;strong>Speed:&lt;/strong> Tanzu Application Service enables rapid time to value for your custom code by managing everything else for you.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>&lt;strong>Scalability:&lt;/strong> Tanzu Application Service uses Cloud Foundry BOSH to help deliver enterprise SLAs as the business grows.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>&lt;strong>Secure by default:&lt;/strong> Tanzu Application Service is highly automated and improves the security posture across the application portfolio, dramatically lowering risks posed by manual processes.&lt;/li>
&lt;/ul>
&lt;p>As an industry-standard cloud platform, TAS for VMs offers the following:&lt;/p>
&lt;ul>
&lt;li>&lt;strong>Open source code:&lt;/strong> The platform’s openness and extensibility prevent its users from being locked into a single framework, set of app services, or cloud.

&lt;li>Compare the quantity of questions you have answered correctly against the total quantity of questions for all tests to ensure you have attained a minimum of 70% correct answers&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Post grade report and updated course record card to your member repository&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Append a message to the pull request to notify the requesting user the course grading is complete, the result, and links to the updated grade report and course record card.
&lt;ul>
&lt;li>The requesting members github account will be mentioned in the posted message, which will trigger a github notification to the requestors github account and associated email address.&lt;/li>
&lt;/ul>
&lt;/li>
&lt;/ul>
&lt;p>In the event that a user requests a certificate and does not have the minimum required grade to pass, a grade report will be provided that will include details on the percent of correct answers for each test in the course, highlighting which test(s) may need to be retaken to achieve a passing grade. Members can then retake any tests necesarry to increase their grade, and then repeat the above process again to request that the certificate service run again.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>If you encounter any problems with testing or with the certificate process, please open an issue ticket on this course.&lt;/p></description></item></channel></rss>
